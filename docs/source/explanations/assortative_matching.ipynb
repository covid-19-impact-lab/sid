    "# Assortative Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "A weakness of many models of infectious diseases is that they do not model well whom and how humans meet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simulation based approach allows us to richly model human interactions through different contact models.\n",
    "One important dimension of this is that we can distinguish recurrent and non-recurrent contacts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Recurrent contacts are met repeatedly with certainty. These would include close family and friends, colleagues, class mates, etc..\n",
    "2. Non-recurrent contacts are met infrequently or randomly. They include people like customers at work, people visiting the same bar etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the second group of contacts and how they can be modeled using assortative matching. Though the contacts are non-recurrent, it does not mean that meeting one of two different people should be equally likely. Assortative matching means that individuals meet each other with differing probabilities based on their characteristics. For example, age is a strong assortative variable because people in the same age group are likely to share the same needs and interests and meet in the same places.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The effect of assortative matching on the spread of a disease\n",
    "\n",
    "Assortative matching can be weaker or stronger and has been speculated to be [a reason why countries like Italy and Spain have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/world/europe/adults-parents-home-coronavirus.html). Adults living with their parents or working in a grocery store are examples that lead to less assortativeness in matching. On the other hand, parents going to playgrounds or university students attending classes are behaviors that make it more likely for people of a similar age to meet. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is the effect of assortative matching on the spread of an infectious disease? To gain an intuition let us focus on two extreme scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If all people meet only members of their own group (perfectly assortative matching), the disease will quickly die out. The disease will be completely contained in the groups where an initial infection exists. It is likely that all members of the group will get the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If there is no assortative matching at all, all contacts are equally likely and there is no containment effect. The disease will spread out and likely infect all people until the dynamics of herd immunity set in.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Thus, there are two forces playing against each other in moderate scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stronger assortative matching makes the disease spread more quickly in groups. But, at some turning point the probability of meeting someone in the same group which has not been infected yet becomes more and more unlikely. The disease will slowly spread to groups without initial infections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the case of weak assortative matching, the disease will quickly spread over the whole population without affecting some subgroups harder than the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Set-Up\n",
    "\n",
    "To study the role of these two forces, we will employ a simple simulation exercise with the following key factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will simulate the spread of a disease in a sample of 100,000 people for one and a half years.\n",
    "- The people are grouped into 5,000 groups which means there are 20 people in one group.\n",
    "- We start with 10 initially infected people which are randomly drawn.\n",
    "- People meet one person each period which is either from her own group or one of the others.\n",
    "- The parameter to control the assortative matching is the probability that a person meets someone from her own group. The remaining probabability is distributed equally among the other groups. For example, if a person meets an individual from her own group with 50% chance, the probability for each other group is $\\frac{1 - 0.5}{4999} \\approx 0.00002$.\n",
    "- We set the infection probability to 20%, i.e. if an infectious and a susceptible person meet, one in five times the susceptible person will catch the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us turn to the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, some import statements."
